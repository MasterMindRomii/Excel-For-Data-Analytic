# Excel Functions Practice

Welcome to the Excel Functions Practice repository! This project focuses on demonstrating and utilizing five common and important Excel functions: IF, SUBSTITUTE, SPLIT, XLOOKUP, and DATEDIF.

## Project Overview

In this project, we cover the following Excel functions:

1. **IF**: Performs logical tests and returns one value for a TRUE result and another for a FALSE result.
2. **SUBSTITUTE**: Replaces occurrences of a specified text string within another text string.
3. **SPLIT**: Divides text into separate columns based on a specified delimiter.
4. **XLOOKUP**: Searches a range or array and returns an item corresponding to the first match it finds.
5. **DATEDIF**: Calculates the difference between two dates in various units (days, months, years).
